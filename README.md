With the creeping extinction of modern web design on Zetaboards, I've
sacrificed my soul, sleep, and virginity to engender this (finally!) responsive
and material theme. Stand up and enamour this theme with an explosive ovation
before *that* fad ends and my sweaty work has been pointless just like it all,
and the theme joins ranks with its current abhorrent antitheses.

Scroll down for the raw juice.

## Features

* Responsive design for your handy mobile devices
* Material design for that modern aesthetic
* Smooth animations and smart transitions
* Beautiful fonts for your delicate eyes
* Small and meaningful color usage
* Quirky hipster rounded avatars
* Ample minimalist spacing
* Staircase bullet lists

## Installing

Just copy/paste the CSS, and layout files into their equivalent pages. I should
probably upload the accompanying buttons and settings files.

## Disclaimer

This is a work in progress. Expect a bumpy ride, for now. Check the source
stylesheet if you're truly curious about the erroneous state this project is in.
