With the creeping extinction of modern web design on Zetaboards, I've
sacrificed my soul, sleep, and dignity to engender this responsive and material
theme. Stand up and enamour with an explosive ovation before the theme's basis
contemporary fad ends and my sweaty work has been pointless and the theme
joins ranks with its current abhorrent antitheses.

* Responsive design for your handy mobile devices
* Material design for that modern aesthetic
* Smooth animations and smart transitions
* Hamburger hamburger hamburger menu
* Beautiful fonts for your delicate eyes
* Small and meaningful color usage

## Installing

Just copy/paste the CSS from `Monochrome.css` and layout from `layout.html` into their respective pages, then add the images/icons from `images.txt`. That's it.

## Disclaimer

This is a work in progress: expect a bumpy ride, for now. Check the top of the
source stylesheet for the TODO/FIXME list if you're truly curious about the
disgusting state this project is in.

If you find something you don't like submit a bug report and I'll see if
there's anything I can do.
