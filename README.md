## About

With the creeping extinction of modern web design on Zetaboards, I've
sacrificed my soul, sleep, and virginity to engender this (finally!) responsive
and material theme. Stand up and enamour this theme with an explosive ovation
before *that* fad ends and my sweaty work has been pointless just like it all,
and the theme joins ranks with its current abhorrent antitheses.

Scroll down for the raw juice.

## Features

* Material design inspired for that modern aesthetic
* Responsive design for your handy mobile devices
* Smooth animations and smart transitions
* Beautiful fonts for your delicate eyes
* Quirky hipster rounded avatars
* Ample minimalist spacing

## Installing

Just copy/paste the CSS, and layout files into their equivalent pages. I should
upload the buttons and settings.

This is a work in progress. Expect a bumpy ride, for now.
