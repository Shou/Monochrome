# About

With the creeping extinction of modern web design on Zetaboards, I've
sacrificed my soul, sleep, and virginity to engender this (finally!) responsive
and material theme. Stand up and enamour this theme with an explosive ovation
before the fad ends and my sweaty work has been pointless just like it all, and
the theme joins ranks with its current abhorrent antitheses.

# Installing

Just copy/paste the CSS, and layout files into their equivalent pages. I should
upload the buttons and settings.

# Disclaimer

This is a work in progress. Expect a bumpy ride, for now.
