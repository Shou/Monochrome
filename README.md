With the creeping extinction of modern web design on Zetaboards, I've
sacrificed my soul, sleep, and dignity to engender this responsive and material

contemporary fad ends and my sweaty work has been pointless and the theme
joins ranks with its current abhorrent antitheses.

Scroll down for the raw juice.

## Installing

Just copy/paste the CSS, and layout files into their equivalent pages. I should
probably upload the accompanying buttons and settings files.

This is a work in progress: expect a bumpy ride, for now. Check the top of the
source stylesheet for the TODO/FIXME list if you're truly curious about the
erroneous state this project is in.
