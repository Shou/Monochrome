## Outdated!
This theme has been superseded by the dark version, [Phosphor](https://github.com/Shou/Phosphor), and sadly all the nice changes have not been pulled into the brighter Monochrome. It's still good, but not as good as Phosphor.

With the creeping extinction of modern web design on Zetaboards, I've
sacrificed my soul, sleep, and dignity to engender this responsive and material
theme. Stand up and enamour with an explosive ovation before the theme's basis
contemporary fad ends and my sweaty work has been pointless and the theme
joins ranks with its current abhorrent antitheses.

## Features

* Responsive design for your handy mobile devices
* Material design for that modern aesthetic
* Smooth animations and smart transitions
* Hamburger hamburger hamburger menu
* Beautiful fonts for your delicate eyes
* Small and meaningful color usage
* Quirky hipster rounded avatars
* Literally Awesome font icons
* Enough minimalist spacing
* Staircase bullet lists

## Installing

Just copy/paste the CSS from `Monochrome.css` and layout from `layout.html` into their respective pages, then add the images/icons from `images.txt`. That's it.
